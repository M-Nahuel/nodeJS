# Node JS

Here are some projects implementing the concepts learned from the [freeCodeCamp's youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hpc70_OoAg) about NodeJS and Express.

The folders are organized containing only examples of each specific concept, but this is not the case with the expressJs folder, which was modified to apply all the concepts learned in a single application and some extra functionalities and validation methods.
